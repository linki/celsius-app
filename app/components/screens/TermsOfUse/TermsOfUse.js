We calculate the interest on your Deposited Digital Assets based on market demand. We will determine the interest rate for each week in our sole discretion, and you acknowledge that such rate may not be equivalent to benchmark interest rates observed in the market for bank deposit accounts or any other purpose.\n" +

            "Interest is gained based on a daily periodic rate to the Deposited Digital Assets in the Account. The daily periodic rate is calculated by dividing the applicable interest rate by three hundred sixty (360) days; then it is further divided down to the hour and minute of that day. Deposited Digital Assets will begin gaining interest according to the hour, minute, and second on the timestamp verifying the completion of the applicable transaction and shall cease and/or decrease the amount paid as interest at the moment when the User has entered a withdrawal and/or transfer (via CelPay) request.\n" +
            "We will credit your Account with the interest earned on or around the first business day of each week. Your Account must be open on such date in order for you to receive the applicable interest payment. All interest will be paid in-kind (in the same Digital Asset that is available in your Account) or in CEL, subject to our regulatory and business considerations. To make such in-kind interest payments as accurate as possible, Celsius rounds non-integer, rational numbers to the sub-cent, which is the smallest possible decimal available for the applicable Digital Asset.\n" +
            "Unless specifically mentioned and agreed by Celsius in writing, interest gained will NOT accrue additional interest (i.e. will NOT earn compound interest), and you will continue to accrue interest based only on your Deposited Digital Assets.\n" +

Celsius is not obligated to credit your Account retroactively with interest that would have been gained if you had otherwise updated your profile with your TIN.\n" +
